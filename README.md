## ⚠️ Important Note
> **First Request Delay**: Since this application is hosted on Render's free tier, the server enters a sleep state after 15 minutes of inactivity. When you make your first request, the server needs to wake up, which can take up to 30-60 seconds. Subsequent requests will work normally.
